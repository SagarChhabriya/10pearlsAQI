### Key Features

- Feature Pipeline Development
    - Fetch raw weather and pollutant data from external APIs like AQICN or OpenWeather
    - Compute features from raw data including time-based features (hour, day, month) and derived features like AQI change rate
    - Store processed features in Feature Store (Hopsworks or Vertex AI)

- Historical Data Backfill
    - Run feature pipeline for past dates to generate training data
    - Create comprehensive dataset for model training and evaluation

- Training Pipeline Implementation
    - Fetch historical features and targets from Feature Store
    - Experiment with various ML models (Random Forest, Ridge Regression, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
    - Evaluate performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics
    - Store trained models in Model Registry
- Automated CI/CD Pipeline
    - Feature pipeline runs every hour automatically
    - Training pipeline runs daily for model updates
    - Use Apache Airflow, GitHub Actions, or similar tools
- Web Application Dashboard
    - Load models and features from Feature Store
    - Compute real-time predictions for next 3 days
    - Display interactive dashboard with Streamlit/Gradio and Flask/FastAPI

- Advanced Analytics Features
    - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends
    - Use SHAP or LIME for feature importance explanations
    - Implement alerts for hazardous AQI levels
    - Support multiple forecasting models from statistical to deep learning
